# CryptoBuddyAI

CryptoBuddy uses rule-based logic to analyze user queries through keyword matching and conditional statements. It processes predefined cryptocurrency data, calculates weighted scores for profitability and sustainability, then generates contextual responses. This mimics AI decision-making by systematically evaluating multiple factors to provide personalized investment recommendations based on user preferences.

Key AI-like Features:

Pattern Recognition: Matches user input keywords to specific investment categories
Data Analysis: Calculates composite scores from multiple data points (price trends, market cap, sustainability)
Decision Trees: Uses if-else logic to determine appropriate responses
Contextual Responses: Generates different advice based on user query type
Weighted Scoring: Combines multiple factors to rank investment options
The chatbot demonstrates fundamental AI concepts like data processing, pattern matching, and automated decision-making, making it an excellent educational example of how AI systems analyze information and provide recommendations.

For your peer group discussion, you can highlight how this project bridges the gap between simple programming logic and more complex AI systems, showing how rule-based approaches can create intelligent-seeming behavior.
